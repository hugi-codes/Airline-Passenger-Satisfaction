# Dockerized Flask Prediction App

This repository contains a Flask application that serves a machine learning model for predictions. The application is packaged into a Docker container for easy local deployment.

## Getting Started

### 1. Build the Docker Image
Ensure your terminal is in the directory containing the `Dockerfile` and run:

```bash
docker build -t flask-predictor:v1 .
```

### 2. Run the Docker Container
Once the Docker image is built, start a container with:

```bash
docker run -it --rm -p 9696:9696 flask-predictor:v1
```

This command runs the Flask app inside a container and exposes it on port `9696`. You can access it at:

```
http://localhost:9696
```

### 3. Make Predictions
Use `score_passenger.py` to send a request to the Flask app and receive a model prediction.

Run the script with:

```bash
python score_passenger.py
```

You can modify `score_passenger.py` to test different inputs.
