## Problem Description 
This project focuses on analyzing airline passenger satisfaction based on a dataset derived from a customer satisfaction survey. The dataset includes various attributes such as demographic details, travel characteristics, and passenger ratings on different aspects of their journey (e.g., inflight services, seat comfort, and cleanliness).

The primary objective is to identify the key factors influencing passenger satisfaction and develop a classification model to predict whether a passenger is satisfied or neutral / dissatisfied. Insights from this analysis can help airlines improve service quality and enhance customer experiences.

## üìä Dataset
The Data is from Kaggle ([link](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/teejmahal20/airline-passenger-satisfaction/data)) and can be downloaded in Python using the `kagglehub` library. For an example of how do this, please check [notebook.ipynb](https://github.com/hugi-codes/Airline-Passenger-Satisfaction/blob/main/notebook.ipynb) or [training.py](https://github.com/hugi-codes/Airline-Passenger-Satisfaction/blob/main/training.py).
